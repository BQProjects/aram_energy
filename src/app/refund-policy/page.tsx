            Refund Policy â€“ The Basics
          </h2>
          <p>
            From this perspective, refund policies are a legally binding
            document that serves to establish the legal relationship between the
            company and its customers regarding how and whether a refund will be
            granted. Online retailers selling products are sometimes required
            (depending on local laws and regulations) to make their product
            return and refund policies publicly available. In some
            jurisdictions, this is required to maintain compliance with consumer
            protection laws. They can also help defend against legal claims from
            customers dissatisfied with the products they purchased.

            What should be included in the refund policy?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Generally, refund policies address the following issues: the
            deadline for requesting a refund; whether a refund will be partial
            or full; under what conditions customers will receive a refund, and
            much more.
